# Sorting-Algorithms---Project
This project aims to provide a basic view of the perfomances of the most well known sorting algorithms - Bubble sort, Merge Sort, Insertion sort, Quick sort and Count sort. The program is written in python. 
It basically first defines the algorithms and then creates multiple arrays of size ranging from 100 to 50,000 random elements. Thus, it prints out the time taken by the respective algorithm for different input sizes. Now, using [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) and [numpy](https://numpy.org/) libraries, the output times are stored and printed in tabular form for comparison and different statistics are used to summarise the minimum and maximum time taken depending on input size. 
Now in the final part, the program visualizes the algorithm timings by plotting them on a graph for which [Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/) and [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) were used.
